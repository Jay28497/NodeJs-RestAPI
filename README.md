# NodeJs-RestAPI

I have to created a simple REST API project with Node Js.

   Node.js - RESTful API - REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol.

   A REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and modifies the resources using HTTP protocol. Here each resource is identified by URIs/ global IDs. REST uses various representation to represent a resource like text, JSON, XML but JSON is the most popular one.
   
# Requirement

   2. npm i joi
   
   3. npm i -g nodemon
